It further has provisions to stop retaliatory measures from platform-holders towards developers who choose to use alternative payment systems that, for example, would have stopped Apple removing Fortnite from the iOS store after Epic installed its own payment system.Companies that don't comply can be fined up to 3% of their South Korean revenue.Unsurprisingly Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, who loves firing barbs at Apple via social media, is cock-a-hoop, and claims this is a pivotal moment in the history of computing platforms.",,['Rich Stanton'],2021-08-31 13:54:07+00:00,2021-08-31T13:54:07.940Z,https://www.pcgamer.com/south-korea-passes-law-with-major-implications-for-apple-vs-epic/,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mx26NN5rFGuNViADatrtRQ-1200-80.jpg,
