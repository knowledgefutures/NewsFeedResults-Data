For $10, you'll get a pair of these nonslip finger sheathes that comes in black with the classic Razer neon green around the base with a logo on each side. The idea is that you put on these thumb sweaters to keep them cool and dry, reducing the likelihood of them slipping off the touchscreen during gameplay. Finger sleeves for mobile gaming aren't new—pro players have been using finger sleeves for competitions for a while, and some even sell their own. So, it makes sense for Razer to get into the market, considering they sell some pretty good mobile gaming gear like the Razer Kishi. If you play hours of shooters like Call of Duty Mobile or even Fortnite on your phone or tablet, you know that a sweaty extremity can affect how you aim, or at least that's what I've been blaming for my poor play on for years.",,['Jorge Jimenez'],2021-09-15 16:50:24+00:00,2021-09-15T16:50:24.148Z,https://www.pcgamer.com/razer-gaming-finger-sleeves/,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hm8yrTmtEmbHdQCTMNiAL4-1200-80.png,
