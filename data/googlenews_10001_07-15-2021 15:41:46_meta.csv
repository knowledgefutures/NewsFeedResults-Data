As well as being added into Resident Evil Village at some point next week, the source code for team Radeon's spatial upscaling technology has just been made available to everyone via the GPUOpen platform.Maybe more importantly for broader future implementation of the upscaling tech, it has today been released, via a beta branch, for the Unity game engine, and as a patch for registered Unreal Engine developers, too. With effectively native support for FSR now baked into two of the biggest third-party game development engines around, there is almost no reason for any game built from them not to incorporate the performance bumping feature.We've been mightily impressed with what we've seen of FidelityFX Super Resolution so far. Sure, it's not going to deliver the sort of frame rate finessing you'll experience with Nvidia's more AI-focused Deep Learning Super Sampling feature, but it's free, open to practically all modern GPUs, and simply works.It's also not been that widely available either. But AMD is announcing a further four titles today, taking the full total to 12. Though it's also worth saying that only Resident Evil Village stands out as a particularly big game to benefit from the FSR update, with Necromunda: Hired Gun, Arcadegeddon, and Edge of Eternity following the horror.Still, with FSR hitting two of the biggest game engines that's only going to find it appearing in the settings screens of more big games.",,['Dave James'],2021-07-15 16:29:49+00:00,2021-07-15T16:29:49.432Z,https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-fsr-resident-evil-village-unity-unreal-engine/,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2dgfLfHYARRAYcqFTg7Mwm-1200-80.jpg,

The difference between most upscaling technologies is how they retain picture quality during that process.

In March 2021, the Cravings author announced that she was leaving Twitter after becoming the target of relentless trolls. “For over 10 years, you guys have been my world. I honestly owe so much to this world we have created here. I truly consider so many of you my actual friends,” she tweeted at the time. “But it’s time for me to say goodbye. This no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively, and I think that’s the right time to call something.” Teigen concluded: “I encourage you to know and never forget that your words matter. No matter what you see, what that person portrays, or your intention. For years I have taken so many small, 2-follower count punches that at this point, I am honestly deeply bruised.” Courtney Stodden, who identifies as non-binary, took to social media to share their past history with Teigen. “What a shame @chrissyteigen is leaving Twitter … it’s too ‘negative’ for herrrrrr #chrissyteigen #bully,” Stodden wrote via Twitter alongside several screenshots of previous message they received from the model. Teigen returned to Twitter in April 2021 after a brief break. One month later, Stodden opened up about the hurtful comments that they received from the Chrissy’s Court alum. “She wouldn’t just publicly tweet about wanting me to take ‘a dirt nap’ but would privately DM me and tell me to kill myself. Things like, ‘I can’t wait for you to die,’” the “Pleasure” singer told the Daily Beast in May 2021. “Some of the worst treatment I got was from women, and we’re not going to get anywhere if we keep holding each other back.” The songwriter revealed that their mental health suffered as a result of the messages they received, including the ones from Teigen. “There have been a lot of evenings where I’ve felt — and still feel — alone. The way my life has been is so tragic that I just feel empty,” Stodden said. Teigen posted a public apology to Stodden two days later, writing, “Not a lot of people are lucky enough to be held accountable for all their past bulls–t in front of the entire world. I’m mortified and sad at who I used to be. I was an insecure, attention seeking troll. I am ashamed and completely embarrassed at my behavior but that is nothing compared to how I made Courtney feel.” Following online backlash about Teigen’s resurfaced messages, the former Lip Sync Battle host posted a lengthy follow-up apology to anyone else she may have hurt. After her second statement, fashion designer Michael Costello accused Teigen of bullying him and threatening his career. “For the past 7 years, I’ve lived with a deep, unhealed trauma,” Costello explained via Instagram in June 2021. “In 2014, I received a public comment from Chrissy Teigen on my Instagram page, accusing me of being racist. She apparently formed her own opinion of me based on a Photoshopped comment floating around the internet which has now been proven to be false by Instagram and since taken down. When I reached out to Chrissy Teigen to communicate that I was the victim of a vindictive cyber slander, and that everything she thought I was is not who I am, she told me that my career was over and that all my doors will be shut from there on.” Teigen did not immediately respond to the Project Runaway alum’s claims and kept a lower profile on social media as the drama continued.

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the 3-D structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence, the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8, has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even where no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experiment in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.",,"['Jumper', 'Deepmind', 'London', 'Evans', 'Pritzel', 'Green', 'Figurnov', 'Ronneberger', 'Tunyasuvunakool', 'Bates']",2021-07-22 00:00:00,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2,https://news.google.com/static/images/favicons/nature/apple-touch-icon.f39cb19454.png,
