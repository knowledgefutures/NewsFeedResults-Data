Although the game is already safe to play, says Amazon, it will release a patch that caps fps on the menu screen to ""reassure"" players. Here's the full statement:Hundreds of thousands of people played in the New World Closed Beta yesterday, with millions of total hours played. We’ve received a few reports of players using high-performance graphics cards experiencing hardware failure when playing New World.New World makes standard DirectX calls as provided by the Windows API. We have seen no indication of widespread issues with 3090s, either in the beta or during our many months of alpha testing.The New World Closed Beta is safe to play. In order to further reassure players, we will implement a patch today that caps frames per second on our menu screen. We’re grateful for the support New World is receiving from players around the world, and will keep listening to their feedback throughout Beta and beyond.Earlier in the day, an Amazon customer service rep acknowledged an issue with ""Nvidia RTX 3090 Series & 100% GPU Usage"" in a forum post. The developer recommends turning off ""the overrides in the driver settings,"" but the only specific instruction given is to set 'Max Frame Rate' to 'Off' in the Nvidia control panel (its default state) and rely on the in-game frame rate limiting option.Original story: The closed beta for Amazon's New World MMO just went live yesterday, and today there are multiple reports that it's somehow killing GeForce RTX 3090 graphics cards.That's hardware that's mighty tough to replace right now.The reports have come through the New World subreddit (crossposted in r/nvidia) after greyone78 posted about the death of their RTX 3090.
