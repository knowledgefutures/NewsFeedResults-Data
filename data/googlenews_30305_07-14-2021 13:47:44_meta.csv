""The people starting fire, the shops, everything, that's why the queue for petrol is like this."" The violence is also hitting the economy.The rand, one of the best performing emerging market currencies during the pandemic, hit a three-month low on Tuesday and continued to hover there on Wednesday (July 14).Local and hard currency bonds have suffered and shares in banks and real estate firms also tanked.On Wednesday an industry official said South Africa's largest refinery, located in Durban, had been temporarily shutdown.",,[],,,https://news.yahoo.com/residents-arm-themselves-against-african-113956752.html,https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-07/14/60eee0322f6b902841def7b8/60eee0322f6b902841def7b9_o_U_v2.jpg,
