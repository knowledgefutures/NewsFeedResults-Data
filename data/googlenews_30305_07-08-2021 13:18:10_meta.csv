Well, good news—you can roll back to Windows 10 with all your data and programs intact. You just have to be really fast about it.The revelation is buried 20 rows deep in Microsoft's FAQ for Windows 11 (via Guru3D), and is only visible after hitting the 'Show more' link to expand the section.""Can I go back to Windows 10 after I upgrade if I don't like Windows 11? Yes. After you have installed the Windows 11 upgrade, there is a 10-day period where you can move back to Windows 10 while keeping files and data that you brought along with you,"" Microsoft explains.After the initial grace period, Microsoft says you will have to manually back up your data and perform a clean installation of Windows 10, if you are just not digging Windows 11.In a sense, you can think of it as a short-term trial period. Ten days is fairly short, but hey, it's better than seven days, or no trial period at all. That at least gives you enough time to kick the tires on Windows 11 and get a little bit acquainted with the changes it introduces.There are quite a few changes, too.
