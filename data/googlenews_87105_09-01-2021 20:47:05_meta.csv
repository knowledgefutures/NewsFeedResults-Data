As screenshots of the new OS leaked out, I was ready to see how Microsoft built on the mostly great foundation it has with Windows 10. I was ready for rounded edges and new icons and even a new take on the Start menu. That enthusiasm lasted until Microsoft published Windows 11's useless PC Health Check tool that told pretty much everyone that their PCs weren't compatible without explaining why. Surely Microsoft's bizarrely short list of compatible CPUs wasn't actually complete, right?It's been a messy two months since that initial announcement day confusion. Microsoft has tried to clarify what you'll actually need to run Windows 11, but only made the true minimum requirements more confusing. It's failed to justify why its requirements are so stringent. And Windows 11 is now set to launch on October 5—a date that seems comically rushed, considering how many people still don't know if they'll be able to use it.How do you screw up the launch of your biggest product this thoroughly before it's even out?",,['Wes Fenlon'],2021-09-01 21:46:55+00:00,2021-09-01T21:46:55.325Z,https://www.pcgamer.com/how-the-hell-is-microsoft-already-screwing-up-windows-11-this-badly/,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W4fz5reCimmaEMXaBuKtgb-1200-80.jpg,
