His remarks come after General Motors addressed the issue in a media release.

“General Motors is voluntarily expanding the current Chevrolet Bolt EV recall to cover the remaining 2019 and all 2020-2022 model year vehicles, including the Bolt EUV,” the company said.

“In rare circumstances, the batteries supplied to GM for these vehicles may have two manufacturing defects – a torn anode tab and folded separator – present in the same battery cell, which increases the risk of fire.

“Out of an abundance of caution, GM will replace defective battery modules in Chevrolet Bolt EVs and EUVs with new modules, with an expected additional cost of approximately $1 billion.”",,[],2021-08-22 01:46:05+00:00,2021-08-22T01:47:39.975Z,https://www.skynews.com.au/opinion/general-motors-recalls-electric-vehicles-because-they-dont-work/video/603291bb33a79457f1948a9d4f6ec94a,https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/47cba12b1bc25eef3710fb3f5044a1e3,
