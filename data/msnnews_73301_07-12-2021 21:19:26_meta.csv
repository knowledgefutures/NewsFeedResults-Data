Pam was the last person to see Betsy alive before she was stabbed to death at her home on December 27, 2011. Just days before Betsy was killed, she made Pam the sole beneficiary of her $150,000 life insurance policy. Betsyâs husband, Russ Faria, was initially charged and convicted of his wifeâs murder.
