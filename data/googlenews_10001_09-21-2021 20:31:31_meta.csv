While the statement states that these investigations are concerning ""certain employment practices"", it's claimed in the Wall Street Journal report that the SEC's investigation scope ""[includes] how the videogame-publishing giant handled employees’ allegations of sexual misconduct and workplace discrimination.""The Wall Street Journal report also claims that several Activision executives have been subpoenaed as part of the SEC investigation, including CEO Bobby Kotick. To that end, Activision Blizzard confirmed in this statement that it is ""complying with a recent [SEC] subpoena issued to the Company and several current and former employees and executives regarding disclosures on employment matters and related issues.""",,['Ben Tyrer'],2021-09-21 16:27:47+00:00,2021-09-21T16:27:47.239Z,https://www.gamesradar.com/au/activision-blizzard-releases-statement-regarding-investigations/,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DVJ62Abmy7iJqWrsbB237C-1200-80.jpg,
