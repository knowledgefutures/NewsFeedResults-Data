Proving he is as prolific as he is talented, the filmmaker is back in the main Cannes competition where his latest film, Drive My Car just had its World Premiere today. Although this brooding and introspective drama is the longest running film in the competition at just 3 hours, I never felt its length despite the fact that the opening credits don't run until 40 minutes into the movie. Clearly Hamaguchi (who fittingly has been compared to current Japanese master Hirokazu Kore-eda, as both seem drawn to deeply humanist cinema), has his own style as on display in this story of long held secrets, regrets, and revelations largely unveiled while on the road in a moving car. It is based on the short story by Haruki Murakami, and turned into a long, but always engaging film by Hamaguchi.",,['Pete Hammond'],2021-07-11 16:07:16+00:00,2021-07-11T16:27:47+00:00,https://deadline.com/2021/07/drive-my-car-cannes-review-japanese-competition-entry-1234790237/,https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hib7T0xs.jpeg?w=1024,
