You scramble around looking for another gun on the ground that you can swap for, trading what's in your hands for whatever junk is close by. And if there isn't anything close by, well, everyone's stuck with what they've got. That ends in Halo Infinite. After 20 years, Halo has added a ""drop weapon"" button.In a preview of Halo Infinite's upcoming technical preview, developer 343 Industries showed off a huge variety of options in Infinite's PC settings, including key bindings and graphics toggles galore. But this one really caught my eye: an option to bind ""drop weapon"" to whatever key you want.""It's been quite fun to use, especially when you're playing with some less experienced players, you can secure rockets for them and hand it over to them and they get to play around with a power weapon they might not normally have gotten,"" says Sam Hanshaw, live operations producer.""Dare we say this is maybe the end of betraying your teammates to take sniper? Possibly?"" jokes community director Brian Jarrard.It sounds like a small feature, but I can see weapon dropping making a significant difference in combat. It at least removes a limitation that players have been working around for a very long time. The tech preview stream didn't show what controller button dropping weapons is bound to by default for console players.Halo Infinite looks deeply configurable, with an FOV slider, options for how centered your gun appears on the screen, even an option to disable the 'speed lines' that appear on the screen when you sprint. You can choose from a range of colors to set the outline that appears around teammates and enemy colors, which will be especially helpful for colorblind players.",,['Wes Fenlon'],2021-07-28 21:53:58+00:00,2021-07-28T22:02:04.996Z,https://www.pcgamer.com/halo-infinite-lets-you-drop-weapons-for-the-first-time-in-series-history/,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M8R3NPTrboSrD3FmL9sq3U-1200-80.jpg,

The X-rays that are seen reflected from the disk4, and the time delays, as variations in the X-ray emission echo or ‘reverberate’ off the disk5,6, provide a view of the environment just outside the event horizon. I Zwicky 1 (I Zw 1) is a nearby narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy7,8. Previous studies of the reverberation of X-rays from its accretion disk revealed that the corona is composed of two components: an extended, slowly varying component extending over the surface of the inner accretion disk, and a collimated core, with luminosity fluctuations propagating upwards from its base, which dominates the more rapid variability9,10. Here we report observations of X-ray flares emitted from around the supermassive black hole in I Zw 1. X-ray reflection from the accretion disk is detected through a relativistically broadened iron K line and Compton hump in the X-ray emission spectrum. Analysis of the X-ray flares reveals short flashes of photons consistent with the re-emergence of emission from behind the black hole. The energy shifts of these photons identify their origins from different parts of the disk11,12. These are photons that reverberate off the far side of the disk, and are bent around the black hole and magnified by the strong gravitational field. Observing photons bent around the black hole confirms a key prediction of general relativity. One of the key predictions of general relativity, the bending of light around massive, compact objects, is observed for a supermassive black hole in the galaxy I Zwicky 1.",,"['Wilkins', 'D.
