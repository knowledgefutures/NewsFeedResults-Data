An Afghan official at the airport in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif said that the would-be passengers were Afghans, many of whom did not have passports or visas, and thus were unable to leave the country.  The top Republican on the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, however, said that the group included Americans and they were sitting on the planes, but the Taliban were not letting them take off, effectively “holding them hostage.""",,['Kathy Gannon'],,,https://news.yahoo.com/taliban-resume-flights-press-assault-142849525.html,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9hjnmxNH.b.sbCF6lHwZXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BaGYLdMq36bhBhFn_8D.tw--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/6ab336db0ecc58151fe176c5a6a53072,
