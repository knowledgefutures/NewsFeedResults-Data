Proton is what Valve is using to make the entire Steam library playable on the Steam Deck, even though relatively few games have native Linux ports.""Starting with the latest SDK release, developers can activate anti-cheat support for Linux via Wine or Proton with just a few clicks in the Epic Online Services Developer Portal,"" the update reads.Epic made Easy Anti-Cheat a free service this year, meaning we're likely to see more of it in future online games.
