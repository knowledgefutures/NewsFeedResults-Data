Congressmen,"" in a reference to Republicans.Throughout the call, Trump repeatedly pushed false claims that the election had been stolen - something that Rosen and Donoghue refuted.Just a little over a week later - these same false claims inspired thousands of his supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election victory.The fact that the Justice Department allowed the handwritten notes to be turned over to congressional investigators marks a dramatic shift from the Trump administration, which repeatedly invoked executive privilege to skirt congressional scrutiny.And, in yet another setback for Trump, the Justice Department on Friday cleared the way for the IRS to hand over his tax records to congressional investigators - a move he has long fought.",,[],,,https://news.yahoo.com/justice-dept-oks-release-trump-204410209.html,https://s.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/prod/2021-07/30/610468dcddb40d39d9966ed3/610468dcddb40d39d9966ed4_o_U_v2.jpg,
