And I'm going to suggest that's maybe a tough sell. It's clear that AMD is aiming at folk wishing to hit triple figure frame rates in competitive shooters at 1080p, specifically those who are willing to spend significant amounts of cash doing so. Just not the sort of significant figure that would get you a significantly better graphics card. That feels like a niche audience when your new generation's most affordable GPU is traditionally meant to be the one which targets the broadest range of PC gamers possible. These are not traditional times, however, and trying to use recent history to inform opinions on newly released graphics cards almost feels like a fool's errand right now. Admittedly, so does talking about such ephemeral concepts as a $379 MSRP, especially in relation to the long-forgotten suggested retail pricing of existing cards. That's something which has long since ceased to have any meaning in the real world.But forming the bottom rung of the RDNA 2 GPU ladder, the Radeon RX 6600 XT is the fifth tier pick of AMD's current graphics card generation. And the fact it's a nigh-on $400 GPU—when that was the price of the previous generation's top Radeon card—probably tells you a lot about the graphics card market right now.AMD is competitive again, and no longer has to exclusively rely on undercutting its Nvidia GeForce rival's top cards. But we're also at a point in history where pretty much every GPU that can be manufactured is guaranteed to be sold, and sold for well above its market value. However much AMD and its partners would like to suggest there will be enough silicon out there to keep sales around this card's stated MSRP, the likelihood is the RX 6600 XT will still sell out just as quickly as all the other GPUs released in the last year, and potentially for similarly exorbitant sums of money.",,['Dave James'],2021-08-10 13:01:31+00:00,2021-08-10T13:01:31.106Z,https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-xfx-merc-308-benchmarks/,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bpxUuWATCHxcZxfYBkHEDE-1200-80.jpg,
