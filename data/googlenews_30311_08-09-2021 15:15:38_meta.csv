Samsung hasn't released a new flagship device since the Galaxy S21 series back in January, but now the wait is finally over. Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2021 is slated to kick off on August 11, 2021, at 10 a.m. ET. Here's what time that works out for those in other areas of the world: San Francisco, US – 07:00 PDT Chicago, US – 09:00 CT Paris, Berlin, Barcelona – 16:00 CEST Dubai, UAE – 18:00 GST New Delhi, IND – 19:30 IST Sydney, AUS – 24:00 How to Watch Samsung Galaxy Unpacked https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7ixp-XwqGI&ab_channel=Samsung As it does with every major event and announcement, Samsung will be hosting a live stream of the Galaxy Unpacked event on YouTube. The company just recently pushed its live stream view to its YouTube channel, so you can bookmark the page as you wait in anticipation. And with the versatility of YouTube, you can watch the event from pretty much wherever you want. Throw it on your phone, watch it on your tablet or computer, or even watch on your big screen TV so you can see all of the announcements. What to expect from Galaxy Unpacked Considering that the tagline for the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event is ""Get ready to unfold"", we are expecting to see both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 introduced. The company has made references to how the future of smartphones are foldable phones, and this signifies Samsung's push of foldable devices into the mainstream. As expected, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 will be the company's new ""flagship"" with a massive inner display paired with a smaller cover display. It's said to feature a design similar to that of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 from 2020, albeit with a few changes here and there. Two of the biggest rumored additions are an official IP water resistance rating and added S Pen support. If you want to experience a foldable phone but don't want to deal with the massive screen offered by the Fold series, then you'll want to keep an eye out for the Galaxy Z Flip 3. The phone offers a clam-shell design just like the two iterations before it. Although we likely won't be seeing S Pen support, Samsung is said to be bringing an IP rating to the Flip as well. But that's not all that Samsung is rumored to introduce, as we are finally going to get some new smartwatches in the rumored Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic. These are set to replace the Galaxy Watch 3, although we're unsure if the ultra-popular Galaxy Watch Active 2 will be replaced. Nevertheless, these are set to be the first two smartwatches powered by Samsung and Google's new combined wearable OS. And while the interface was teased at MWC 2021, Samsung didn't provide an in-depth look. Finally, Samsung's expected to show off some new earbuds with the Galaxy Buds 2. These have been leaked to high heaven and according to the leaked specs, will offer ANC and up to 28 hours of battery life. We have seen renders of these appearing with a few different color options, and pricing is expected to be between $150 and $200.",,[],2021-08-11 12:15:25+00:00,2021-08-11T12:17:42Z,https://phandroid.com/2021/08/11/how-to-watch-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021/,https://phandroid.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-august-2021-640x480.png,
