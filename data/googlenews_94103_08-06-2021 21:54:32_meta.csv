The highly infectious Delta variant has become the dominant coronavirus type globally, sustaining a pandemic that has already killed more than 4.4 million people, including over 130,000 in Britain.",,[],,,https://news.yahoo.com/england-says-delta-infections-produce-105701728.html,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VtM1LubfwCmVbwrjkoJ2cA--~B/aD01MzA7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/ef4e6b01a64e6efada9b6affc150f95d,
